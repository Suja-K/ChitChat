# ChitChat
An open source chat application written in python.
Here is the tutorial on how to use it: https://medium.com/@thesanjeetc/3a37dd37c1bd

Here is a break down of how it works:

1) All messages are sent and fetched to and from one single gmail account.
2) Therefore, whoever runs it, especially from a shared folder, there is no setup required and the user can chat with everybody else who is running the script, configured with the same gmail account.
3) Only one person needs to configure my script with their new gmail account and then distribute it or put it in a shared folder where anybody can run it.

What makes this different from other chat applications is that no server script needs to be running, so anybody can just run the script and chat with other users also running the script. The name will just be the username of the account logged in as.

This is ideal for the school environment for which I created it for, especially during lessons. After putting it in a shared directory, anybody can navigate to it and run it.

Also, all messages are stored in one account and once distributed, it can be used to chat from anywhere around the world.

For setup, please see link above.

Have fun ChitChatting!

NOTE: This is written for python 3 onwards
